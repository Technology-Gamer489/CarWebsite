# CarWebsite
A simple car website that will showcase accessibility and other features, and will gradually expand over time.

Currently (as of the 19th of July 2024), I am NOT giving this repo a licence, which means that all code is mine (unless otherwise stated). In the future, this may change, and this README file will update if so.

If anyone wishes to provide feedback, provide ideas or collaborate, contact me.
